## Weather Station Connection Options

### Option 1: Manual Data Integration (Immediate)
**Best for: Getting your station data into the system right away**

1. Check your Smart Life app for current readings
2. Note down values (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.)
3. Use the dashboard's manual data entry feature
4. Add your station readings alongside automatic data

### Option 2: Fix Tuya Cloud API (Recommended)
**Current Issue**: Signature validation failing despite correct credentials

3. Try regenerating credentials:
   - Delete current Access ID/Secret
   - Create new ones

4. Check project region alignment:
   - Device location must match project data center
   - EU devices → EU project
   - Recreate project in correct region if needed

### Option 3: Local Network Integration
**Current Issue**: Device not discovered on local network

**Troubleshooting**:
1. Ensure weather station and computer on same WiFi network
2. Check router settings for device isolation
3. Try connecting to station's local IP directly
4. Some stations broadcast on specific ports (6668, 6667)

### Option 4: Alternative Data Sources
**For continuous monitoring while resolving station connection**:
- Current: Meteostat (professional weather data)
- Backup: OpenWeatherMap API
- Manual: Smart Life app readings
- Local: WiFi weather station protocols

## Immediate Next Steps

2. **Try fresh Tuya credentials** - Regenerate API keys
3. **Check local network settings** - Router configuration
4. **Manual data entry** - Add station readings to compare
